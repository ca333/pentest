# Network Penetration Test Tool

This Rust-based command-line tool allows you to perform a soft penetration test on a target IP address and port. It sends a predefined number of packets using either the TCP or UDP protocol to test the network's capability.

## Features

- Support for both TCP and UDP protocols
- Customizable packet payload
- Adjustable packet count
- Configurable concurrency level (number of threads)
- Debug output for monitoring progress

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ca333/pentest
cd pentest


2. Build the project:

cargo build --release


3. Run the penetration test tool with the desired parameters:

./target/release/pentest [IP_ADDRESS] [PORT] [COUNTER] [PROTOCOL] [PAYLOAD] [CONCURRENCY]


Replace the parameters as needed:

- `IP_ADDRESS`: Target IP address (e.g., `127.0.0.1`)
- `PORT`: Target port number (e.g., `7777`)
- `COUNTER`: Number of packets to send (e.g., `1000`)
- `PROTOCOL`: Protocol to use: `TCP` or `UDP`
- `PAYLOAD`: Packet payload as a string (e.g., `"Test payload"`)
- `CONCURRENCY`: Number of threads for concurrent packet sending (e.g., `5`)

## Example

To test a local server listening on IP address `127.0.0.1`, port `7777`, sending 1000 packets using the TCP protocol, with a payload of `"Test payload"` and using 5 threads, run the following command:

./target/release/pentest 127.0.0.1 7777 1000 TCP "Test payload" 5

## TODO

- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Modularize the code
- [ ] Add unit tests and integration tests
- [ ] Implement CI/CD
- [ ] Implement command-line argument parsing using `clap` or `structopt`
- [ ] Add/Enhance documentation
- [ ] Allow configuration via a file
- [ ] Integrate a logging library
- [ ] Implement clusterization via containers
- [ ] Support additional protocols (e.g., ICMP, HTTP)
